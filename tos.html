In connection with our Service, we have adopted and implemented a policy respecting copyright law that provides for the removal of any infringing materials and for the termination, in appropriate circumstances, of users of our online Service who are repeat infringers of intellectual property rights, including copyrights. If you believe that one of our users is, through the use of our Service, unlawfully infringing the copyright(s) in a work, and wish to have the allegedly infringing material removed, the following information in the form of a written notification (pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)) must be provided to our designated Copyright Agent:
your physical or electronic signature;
identification of the copyrighted work(s) that you claim to have been infringed;
identification of the material on our services that you claim is infringing and that you request us to remove;
sufficient information to permit us to locate such material;
your address, telephone number, and e-mail address;
a statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the objectionable material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or under the law; and
a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are either the owner of the copyright that has allegedly been infringed or that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.</p>
<p>Please note that, pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512(f), any misrepresentation of material fact (falsities) in a written notification automatically subjects the complaining party to liability for any damages, costs and attorney’s fees incurred by us in connection with the written notification and allegation of copyright infringement.</p>
<h2>9. Purchase</h2>
<p><strong>9.1 Purchasing process.</strong>
Any order placed is an offer to purchase the Service. Orders are subject to availability and are accepted at the discretion of the Owner. Users must select the desired Service, choosing the type and duration that best suit them, and check-out only after having carefully verified the information contained in the Order Summary Form of the Order. The Order is placed on confirmation of the Order and is subject to payment of the amount charged in the Order Summary.
The Order Processing Receipt does not constitute acceptance of the Order. The contract shall be concluded at the time of the Order Confirmation by the Owner to the email address provided by the User. The Owner reserves the right not to confirm an order, should one or more of the Services purchased be unavailable. In this case, the Owner will notify the User about the unavailability of the Services purchased within 5 working days from order – to the email address associated with the purchase – and will provide for a refund of any amounts paid by the User.
To place an order, Users must register on the site providing the requested data. The indicated prices include taxes, fees and charges of the law applicable. The Owner reserves the right to offer discounts and various promotions throughout the year. For more details on current promotions, the User is asked to contact the Owner via the contact information contained herein.</p>
<p><strong>9.2 Recurring subscription.</strong>
Some of the Services offered by this Service are available via recurring subscriptions. In this case, payments start from the date when Users choose a paid subscription or modify another existing payment plan. The subscription must be renewed at each payment cycle to maintain the benefits provided by the paid services.</p>
<p><strong>9.3 Automatic renewal.</strong>
Recurring subscriptions are renewed automatically through the payment method that the User chose at the time of purchase. The renewed subscription will last for an equal period of time as the original service period. Users may cancel automatic renewal at any time by changing their preferences for the payment method used. If the User cancels an automatic renewal, then this Service may be forced to cancel their subscription when it runs out.</p>
<p><strong>9.4 Automatic update of subscription plans.</strong>
Some subscription plans available on this Service may be automatically updated in the event that the defined use thresholds as set forth in the User’s current plan are exceeded. In these cases, the subscription plan will be automatically updated to the level that fits the User’s needs in order to ensure the continuity of the provision of the Service.
The methods of payment used correspond to the payment method the User has chosen for subscribing to the original plan. The User is obliged to check that these payment methods are valid in order to allow the automatic update of the subscription plan to function properly. If the payment methods chosen by the User result in unfit or unsuitable for use, the Owner may be forced to suspend the provision of the Service.
The User is free to turn off this automatic upgrade feature through the Service interface or by contacting the Owner. In this case, however, if the User exceeds the maximum use thresholds as set forth in the chosen subscription plan and fails to independently perform the update to the respective necessary plan, the Owner might be forced to suspend the provision of the Service.
In any case, the Owner will attempt to do its best to alert the User via email upon approaching the maximum use thresholds and, therefore, about the need to update the current subscription plan.</p>
<p><strong>9.5 Disabling the service, withdrawal and refund.</strong>
Users may discontinue the Service at any time using the tools provided in the interface of this Service or by contacting the Owner directly.
When disabled, Users are not allowed to claim for payments already made even if these relate to unused portions of the Service purchased.
The Owner reserves the right, however, in its sole discretion and without involving charges or obligation to Users generally, to grant reimbursement in very exceptional cases after evaluating the specific circumstances of the case.
In accordance with the right of withdrawal, the User may, within 14 days from the date of activation or payment of the Service, make a refund request, by sending notice to the Owner via the contact information provided in this document and including any information necessary to identify the purchase to which the claim relates.
Refunds will be made within 14 days after receipt of the request using the same payment method involved during the original purchase.
For more information or for assistance regarding a refund request, the User is asked to contact the Owner via the contact information provided on this Service.</p>
<p><strong>9.6 Methods of payment.</strong>
This Service uses third-party tools for its payment processing and is not connected with any of the provided payment information – such as the credit card – in any way.
If the owner of any of such third-party tools refuses to authorize a payment, the Owner cannot provide the Service and will therefore not be liable for any delay or failure to deliver.</p>
<p><strong>9.7 Duration.</strong>
The duration of the Service is indicated at the moment of payment of the price and confirmed in the Order Confirmation email sent by the Owner.</p>
<p><strong>9.8 Changing the payment plan.</strong>
Users are free to change the chosen payment plan at any time.
In case the User modifies their current payment plan, the portion of the previous plan that has not yet been used shall be converted into a bonus which can be applied to the plan the User is switching to, on a pro-rata basis and in the form of a free period.
If a currency conversion is required, the exchange rate criteria set forth in the specific paragraph of the present document shall apply.</p>
<p><strong>9.9 Currency conversion.</strong>
The exchange rate is the one established by the payment processor. In lack of such a rate, this Service will use the rate established by the European Central Bank at the moment of the relevant transaction.</p>
<h2>10. General</h2>
<p><strong>10.1 Changes</strong>. These Terms are subject to occasional revision, and if we make any substantial changes, we may notify you by sending you an e-mail to the last e-mail address you provided to us (if any), and/or by prominently posting notice of the changes on our Service. You are responsible for providing us with your most current e-mail address. In the event that the last e-mail address that you have provided us is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering to you the notice described above, our dispatch of the e-mail containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice of the changes described in the notice. Any changes to these Terms will be effective upon the earlier of thirty (30) calendar days following our dispatch of an e-mail notice to you (if applicable) or thirty (30) calendar days following our posting of notice of the changes on our Service. These changes will be effective immediately for new users of our Service. Continued use of our Service following notice of such changes shall indicate your acknowledgement of such changes and agreement to be bound by the terms and conditions of such changes.</p>
<p><strong>10.2 Dispute Resolution</strong>. Please read this Arbitration Agreement carefully. It is part of your contract with the Company and affects your rights. It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.
(2.a) Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. All claims and disputes (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth below) in connection with the Terms or the use of any product or service provided by the Company that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and the Company, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the Terms.
(2.b) Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution. Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”) describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief. A Notice to the Company should be sent to the address of the Company specified in the &quot;Contact information&quot; section below. After the Notice is received, you and the Company may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally. If you and the Company do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award, if any, to which either party is entitled.</p>
<p><strong>10.3 Governing law and jurisdiction</strong>. These Terms and any dispute concerning the implementation, interpretation and validity of this agreement are subject to the law, the jurisdiction of the state and to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts where the Owner has their registered offices. An exception to this rule applies in cases, where the law provides a sole place of jurisdiction for consumers.</p>
<p><strong>10.4 Online dispute resolution for consumers</strong>. The consumer resident in Europe must be aware that the European Commission has established an online platform for alternative dispute resolutions that provides for an out-of-court method to solve any dispute related to and stemming from online sale and service contracts. As a consequence, if you are a European consumer, you can use such a platform for resolving any dispute stemming from the online contract entered into with the Owner. The Owner is available for any questions via the email address posted under the Owner's information in this document.</p>
<p><strong>10.5 Export</strong>. The Service may be subject to European Union export control laws and may be subject to export or import regulations in other countries. You agree not to export, reexport, or transfer, directly or indirectly, any technical data acquired from the Company, or any products utilizing such data, in violation of the European Union export laws or regulations.</p>
<p><strong>10.6 Electronic Communications</strong>. The communications between you and Company use electronic means, whether you use the Service or send us emails, or whether Company posts notices on the Service or communicates with you via email. For contractual purposes, you (a) consent to receive communications from Company in an electronic form; and (b) agree that all terms and conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that Company provides to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications would satisfy if it were be in a hardcopy writing. The foregoing does not affect your non-waivable rights.</p>
<p><strong>10.7 Entire Terms</strong>. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the use of the Service. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. The word “including” means “including without limitation”. If any provision of these Terms is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of these Terms will be unimpaired and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law. Your relationship to Company is that of an independent contractor, and neither party is an agent or partner of the other. These Terms, and your rights and obligations herein, may not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise transferred by you without Company’s prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void. Company may freely assign these Terms. The terms and conditions set forth in these Terms shall be binding upon assignees.</p>

All trademarks, logos and service marks (“Marks”) displayed on the Site are our property or the property of other third parties. You are not permitted to use these Marks without our prior written consent or the consent of such third party which may own the Marks.</p>
